This document outlines the documentation structure, standards, and initial tasks for the project. All documentation will be maintained in the `docs/` directory and key implementation tasks will be tracked using GitHub Gists.

## 2. Documentation Structure
- `architecture.md`: System architecture, module interactions, and deployment diagrams.
- `security.md`: Security best practices, API key management, wallet integration, and audit logging.
- `testing.md`: Static code analysis, unit/integration testing strategy, and code coverage requirements (90%+).
- `setup.md`: Local and cloud setup instructions for backend and frontend.
- `agents.md`: Design and extensibility of agentic modules.
- `strategies.md`: Trading strategy design and extensibility.
- `gist_management.md`: Gist-based task management system design and usage.

## 3. Documentation Standards
- All code must be accompanied by docstrings and inline comments.
- All modules must have a corresponding markdown file in `docs/`.
- All tasks and design notes must be tracked in GitHub Gists and referenced in `docs/gist_management.md`.

## 4. Initial Documentation Tasks
