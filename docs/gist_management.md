# Gist Management System Design

## Purpose
The Gist Management module will:
- Track all implementation, testing, and documentation tasks as GitHub Gists.
- Sync Gists with local project state (completed/pending).
- Allow referencing, updating, and closing tasks from code or UI.
- Ensure traceability and transparency for all work items.

## Features
- Create, update, and close Gists via API.
- Tag Gists by module (e.g., backend, frontend, agents, strategies, docs).
- Link Gists to code commits and documentation.
- Display Gist status in dashboard and CLI.

## Implementation Plan
1. Integrate with GitHub Gist API (Python backend module).
2. Define Gist schema: title, description, tags, status (pending/completed), related files/commits.
3. Build CLI and dashboard UI for Gist management.
4. Sync Gist status with local task progress.
5. Document all Gist management workflows in this file.

## Security
- Use GitHub OAuth or personal access tokens securely (never hardcoded).
- Log all Gist operations for audit.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement Python module for Gist API integration
- [ ] Define Gist schema and conventions
- [ ] Build CLI and dashboard UI for Gist management
- [ ] Document usage and workflows here

---
All Gist management features must be covered by unit tests and static analysis, with 90%+ code coverage.
