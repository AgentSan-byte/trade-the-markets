# Static Code Analysis and Testing Strategy

## Static Code Analysis
- All code (Python and TypeScript) must pass static analysis before merging.
- Tools:
  - Python: flake8, mypy, bandit (security)
  - TypeScript: eslint, typescript compiler (tsc)
- Integrate static analysis into CI/CD pipeline.

## Unit Testing
- All modules must have unit tests with at least 90% code coverage.
- Tools:
  - Python: pytest, coverage.py
  - TypeScript: jest, ts-jest, react-testing-library
- Coverage reports must be generated and reviewed for every PR.

## Integration Testing
- Backend and frontend integration points must be covered.
- Use test doubles/mocks for external APIs (e.g., wallet, exchanges).

## CI/CD
- Use GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and coverage checks.
- Block merges if coverage < 90% or static analysis fails.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Set up static analysis tools in backend and frontend
- [ ] Set up unit/integration test frameworks
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to CI/CD
- [ ] Document test writing guidelines

---
All code must be documented and tested to meet these standards.
